# web_project_3 by Iliya Gomon

This is my third project in the yandex web development program.

In this project I built a responsive web page according to a layout/spec in the "Figama" designers tool. <br>It contained all the texts, fonts, colors and sizes.
I used media query and more responsive tools, hover, positioning, flex-box and grid display, and organized this project with the BEM naming convetion.

The deployed result - https://iliyaa7.github.io/web_project_3/
