# web_project_3 by Iliya Gomon

This is my third project at the yandex web development course.

In this project I built a responsive web page according to a layout/spec in the "Figama" designers tool. It contained all the texts, fonts and colors and sizes but this time (compared to the seconed project) I had to figure out the display, elments names and the nesting by myself.
I used media query, responsive tools like width values in pracentage and more, hover, nth of type pasudo class, positioning, flex  and grid display, and BEM orgonaizing system.

In the near future I am planning to improve the responsivity of the project and make some smooth transitions.
